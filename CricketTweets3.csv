Epitome of Concentration & Technically perfect batter...

Just a small snippet from his glittering career & a famous story:

34 Openers have played 10 or more Tests for India:
Gavaskar played the most: 119 & yet he hold the highest batting avg among all(50.29)

18 Indian openers managed to play 10 or more Tests outside home:
here again Gavaskar stands tall with highest & the only one with 50+ avg(52.9)

16 Indian Openers played 10 or more Tests outside Asia
& again Gavaskar is the only one with 50+ avg(51.6, no one else even reached 45 avg)

Till date he remains the only cricketer to hit double centuries in all four innings of Tests...

His batting avg was above 40 in all 4 innings & his 4th inning avg of 58 is by far the highest among all Indian batters(no one scored even 500 runs with 50 avg in 4th inning)

Now something about his ODi career as common perception built around him for his only one inning of 1975 World Cup..

In his last phase(after 1983 world cup): Gavaskar scored 1870 runs with 43.5 Avg & 65.8 SR as an opener in ODIs...

This might sound normal numbers in current times but trust me, no other opener in the world scored more runs than him with a better Avg/SR
between 1983-87 World Cup...

While turbulent times awaited Indian cricket, after the match fixing scandal was unearthed. Cricket seemed to be in shambles and people seemed to have lost faith, and that's where Ganguly created a blend of youngsters with seniors like Dravid, Sachin, Kumble and Srinath. 
Zones really didn't matter to him, players did. Players like Yuvraj, Zaheer, Ashish, Sehwag, Bhajji were brought into the team and backed well. 
It was the 2000 Knockout Trophy, where India had reached the finals against the Kiwis, Sourav had a century in both semis and finals, though India eventually lost to the Kiwis courtesy Chris Cairns' brilliance. (9/n)",N,294,44,4,Y

The selectors wanted to drop Bhajji and play Sarandeep Singh, after the Mumbai test. Dada was adamant and wanted Bhajji to continue, and his decision turned out to be fruitful for India.
